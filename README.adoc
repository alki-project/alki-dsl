Alki::Dsl is a library for building DSLs. The resulting DSL buliders can be used standalone or as builders for
https://github.com/alki-project/alki-loader[Alki::Loader].

Alki::Dsl also allows composing and extending DSLs and comes with built in DSLs for building classes and
new DSLs.

## Synopsis

```ruby
require 'alki/dsl'

strings_dsl = Alki::Dsl.build 'alki/dsls/dsl' do
  init do
    @strings = []
  end

  dsl_method :add do |val|
    @strings << val
  end

  finish do
    ctx[:result] = @strings.join("\n")
  end
end

val = strings_dsl.build do
  add "hello"
  add "world"
end

puts val

# output:
# hello
# world
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'alki-dsl'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install alki-dsl

## Usage

All DSLs created with Alki::Dsl are Class objects with `::build` methods. These build methods take an optional
hash of parameters, along with a ruby block to be evaluated. DSLs created with Alki::Dsl cannot directly
evaluate strings, just ruby blocks.

While DSLs can be created with Alki::Dsl manually, the easiest way is to use the provided "dsl" DSL. Each
DSL defines any number of "dsl methods", which are methods that will be exposed to the user of the DSL.
The DSL can also define "init" and "finish" blocks which will be run before and after the DSL is evaluated.

DSLs can "require" other DSLs, causing both of their methods to be available to the user.

DSLs are always evaluated within a new instance, so instance variables can be used to store state, however
these will not be accessible to other DSLs being evaluated at the same time (via requires).

Data is passed into and out of a DSL via the `ctx` hash. It is initially set using the hash provided to the
DSLs build method, but can be updated by code in the DSL. Unlike instance variables, all DSLs being run share
a single ctx hash, so it can be used to pass data between them.

The result of the build method will either be the full ctx hash, or just the value of `ctx[:result]` if it
exists (including if it's set to false or nil).

```ruby
require 'alki/dsl'

strings_dsl = Alki::Dsl.build 'alki/dsls/dsl' do
  init do # Init block, runs before any dsl methods are called
    ctx[:strings] = [] # Store strings in ctx so other DSLs can access them
  end

  dsl_method :add do |val| # Simple dsl method called "add"
    ctx[:strings] << val
  end

  finish do # Finish block, runs after any dsls methods are called
    sep = ctx[:separator] || "\n" # Allow caller of dsl to set the separator
    ctx[:result] = ctx[:strings].join(sep) # Set ctx[:result] so we only return this value
  end
end

my_dsl = Alki::Dsl.build 'alki/dsls/dsl' do
  require_dsl strings_dsl # Require other DSL. Value can also be a "load" string (see Alki::Loader section)

  init do # This init block will be run *after* the strings_dsl one
    @transform = nil
  end

  dsl_method :transform do |&blk|
    @transform = blk # Don't need to share this, so just use instance variable
  end

  finish do # This finish block will be run *before* the strings_dsl one.
    if @transform
      ctx[:strings].map! &@transform
    end
  end
end

result = my_dsl.build(separator: ', ') do # Pass in a separator via data hash
  transform(&:capitalize)

  add "hello"
  add "world"
end

puts result

# output: Hello, World

```

#### Helpers ####

In addition to defining dsl methods, the 'dsl' DSL also allows defining helper methods,
which can be called within other dsls that require it.

```ruby
require 'alki/dsl'

strings_dsl = Alki::Dsl.build 'alki/dsls/dsl' do
  init do
    ctx[:strings] = []
  end

  helper :set_separator do |sep|
    ctx[:separator] = sep
  end

  dsl_method :add do |val|
    ctx[:strings] << val
  end

  finish do
    sep = ctx[:separator] || "\n"
    ctx[:result] = ctx[:strings].join(sep)
  end
end

my_dsl = Alki::Dsl.build 'alki/dsls/dsl' do
  require_dsl strings_dsl

  dsl_method :separator do |sep|
    set_separator sep # Call helper from strings_dsl
  end
end

result = my_dsl.build do
  separator ' '

  add "hello"
  add "world"
end

puts result

# output: hello world
```

### Using with Alki::Loader

https://github.com/alki-project/alki-loader[Alki::Loader] is a library that extends Ruby's `require` method.
It can be used to associate "builder" objects with files
or directories so that the code within them is processed by the builder object when they are loaded. More
documentation can be found at the Alki::Loader https://github.com/alki-project/alki-loader[github page].

The DSLs created by Alki::Dsl can be used as Alki::Loader builder objects, allowing DSLs to be used to define
classes and modules. In addition, because the provided "dsl" DSL creates classes, it can also be used with
Alki::Loader to allow defining your DSLs in standalone source files.

To get started, in your project create a dsls directory at something like `lib/my_project/dsls`. This will
be where we put our DSL source files.

To register it create a `lib/alki_loader.rb` file:

.lib/alki_loader.rb
```ruby
# Treat all ruby source files in lib/my_project/dsls as DSL definition files
Alki::Loader.register 'my_project/dsls', builder: 'alki/dsls/dsl'
```

****
*Note*: This registers the builder using a string. This is a "load" string and is used frequently in Alki
projects. When used, the string will be `require`-d and then transformed into a constant name
(so "alki/dsls/dsl" becomes Alki::Dsls::Dsl) and the resulting class will be used. In addition to less
typing, this also allows lazy loading behavior, where the file and class are only loaded if needed.

The DSL class can be passed directly instead of the load string.
****

Now a DSL definition file can be created in `lib/my_project/dsls`. Revisiting the previous example, a "strings"
dsl file can be created. Because the file has been registered with the 'alki/dsls/dsl' builder,
it will be automatically processed as a DSL definition when loaded.

.lib/my_project/dsls/strings.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  init do
    ctx[:strings] = []
  end

  dsl_method :add do |val|
    ctx[:strings] << val
  end

  finish do
    sep = ctx[:separator] || "\n"
    ctx[:result] = ctx[:strings].join(sep)
  end
end
```

The `Alki do ... end` block is part of Alki::Loader and is required. The rest of the DSL is the same
as before. When this file is loaded by Ruby, it will create a DSL class called MyProject::Dsls::Strings.

To use we can require the file normally (making sure to add `lib` to the load path and requiring 'alki/dsl'
first).

```
$ irb -Ilib
> require 'alki/dsl'
> require 'my_project/dsls/strings'
> MyProject::Dsls::Strings.build do
>   add "hello"
>   add "world"
> end
 => "hello\nworld"
>
```

The second DSL can now be setup the same way. Note that the `require_dsl` value has been replaced with a load
string.

.lib/my_project/dsls/transformable_strings.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  require_dsl 'my_project/dsls/strings'

  init do
    @transform = nil
  end

  dsl_method :transform do |&blk|
    @transform = blk
  end

  finish do
    if @transform
      ctx[:strings].map! &@transform
    end
  end
end
```

So what if we want to use our DSL with Alki::Loader as well? First, our DSL right now produces
a string, but Alki::Loader requires builders to define a constant with the correct name. Alki::Dsl comes with a
"class" DSL that makes this easy. First lets create a new DSL that adapts our transformable_strings DSL into a one
that defines a module.

.lib/my_project/dsls/strings_class.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  require_dsl 'alki/dsls/class'
  require_dsl 'my_project/dsls/transformable_strings', :after # This makes it's finish hook
                                                              # run before ours

  finish do
    # Helpers provided by alki/dsls/class
    create_as_module # Don't need a class, just a module
    value = ctx[:result]
    add_class_method(:value) { value }
  end
end
```

Now we can create a new directory, register it with Alki::Loader, and add a file that uses the DSL. Note
that we can set separator in the Alki::Loader register call. Any data values set here are passed in
as `ctx` in the DSL.

.lib/alki_loader.rb
```ruby
Alki::Loader.register 'my_project/dsls', builder: 'alki/dsls/dsl'
Alki::Loader.register 'my_project/strings', builder: 'my_project/dsls/strings_class', separator: ', '
```

.lib/my_project/strings/hello_world.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  transform &:capitalize

  add "hello"
  add "world"
end
```

```
$ irb -Ilib
> require 'alki/dsl'
> require 'my_project/strings/hello_world'
> MyProject::Strings::HelloWorld.value
 => "Hello, World"
>
```
